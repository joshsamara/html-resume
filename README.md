This is my resume made entirely with HTML and CSS.

You can check it out: [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joshsamara-public/resume/resume.html).

*(Note: The publish version here will have phone/address redacted, you can email me
for a non-redacted copy.)*

You can print it out nicely in most modern web browsers by opening the print
dialog and hiding any headers/footers. In some browsers (like Chrome) you'll
 also want to reduce default padding.
